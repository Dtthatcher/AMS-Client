# AMS-Client

As part of an interview I was given a short amount of time to create a full stack web App that had to fulfill the follwing criteria:

<ol>
<li>Create a basic database with tables for people, buildings, floors, and rooms</li>
<li>Make a basic web page that logs in with a user name and password</li>
<li>Make a form that inserts a new room into the database (you can pre-populate bldg., floor, people data)</li>
<li>Create link that displays all rooms on the web page sorted by building, floor, room</li>
</ol>

The local DB was MySQL
The backend is Kotlin KTOR with exposed DSL for DB calls
The frontend is a basic Create React App with ReactStrap and Hooks

The repo is spit into a frontend and backend branch for easier readability

Feel free to review the code and reach out if you have any questions!
